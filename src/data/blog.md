### Thoughts

The GhettoQL tool is functional and I find it very helpful, powerful even. But there is a lot of work that could be on documentation. However, I feel like writing documentation for it is a waste until I really nail down the syntax.

I've never really built anything like this, an app built for building other apps. It's a different mindset, and there's so many ways to approach the problem that it is a bit paralyzing. I suppose that's why there's so many languages out there. But that's why this is so fun.

But before I write polished documentation, and before I polish syntax, I should really think about what sort of tool this is to begin with. 

* Library
* Framework
* Query Language

The definition of all these are a bit lost me, blurred would be the better word. 

There are aspects of the pip package that would be considered library-esque. Especially, the tools I have created for more easily integrating with google sheets.

There are also parts that resemble a framework. The core functionality is useless if you do not follow the flightpath structure. 

The JSON like structure also seems to behave like language in a way. It sort of queries the HTML page and groups data at the same time.

### Plans
I have just written a rough draft for the about section to articulate what my goals are and what Ghettobird does and hopes to do. I can leave GhettoQL untouched for now as I'm trying to piece togethor this proof of concept.

Here's what needs to be done:

* Styling
* Modify my backend to accept a blueprint ID in the request, and the GraphQL query in the body.
* Shift the GraphQL logic (or at least replicate it) to the backend.
